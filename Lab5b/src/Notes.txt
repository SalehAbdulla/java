Amend the code for Question 4. Change the menu so that option 4 is “Exit”.
If the password is incorrect, the user should be repeatedly asked for the correct password. When password is correct,
we want to repeatedly display the menu in the following cases:

if the user enters 1-3
if the user enters an invalid number.
Choosing 4 in the menu will exit the program which means the program should end.

Hint: Use 2 booleans, one for the first loop and one for the second loop.

For example:

Test	Input	Result
menu();
pwd123
3
4

Enter your password
1. Choice 1
2. Choice 2
3. Choice 3
4. Exit
You have entered choice 3
1. Choice 1
2. Choice 2
3. Choice 3
4. Exit
