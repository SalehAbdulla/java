You are planning a holiday in Europe in the summer. You have checked some prices of hotels, travel, food, etc in Euros.
You are not sure yet how much money you will have to spend in the summer.

Write  a program which will convert BD amounts to Euros.

Notes:

Assume that  1 BD = 1.85 Euro.
If the user enters -99 the program will exit.
Amounts should be formatted to 2 decimal places (not compulsory 1.500 shows as 1.5, 200.000 shows as 200, 12.250 shows as 12.25).
Output from and input to the program should be similar to the example below
